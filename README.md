# pelican-via-google-colab
Notebooks for playing with the pelican python site generator, for when installing and configuring things on local computers is more trouble than its worth (eg, in a classroom setting)

For Collection Builder, see [Frederick Elwert's repository here.](https://github.com/frederik-elwert/pelican-collection-demo)

With regard to both notebooks, if you have a folder of .md files (for the first one), or a csv with objects & metadata & a folder with images (for the second one), zip your materials up and upload then unzip into the appropriate folders to generate with your own stuff. Otherwise, to just see how things work, use the default materials provided.
